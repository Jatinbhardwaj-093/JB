When I first started contributing, I felt <em class="italic bg-indigo-50/50 dark:bg-indigo-900/10 px-2 py-0.5 rounded inline-block">overwhelmed by the codebase</em>, especially since I had no prior work experience. Later, I discovered that even people with years of experience often take months to adjust to a new library or technology. Now, that makes complete sense. For example, shifting from a web-focused library to something machine learning-related involves a drastic change in coding practices. Over time, you become more familiar with the library. <strong class="font-bold text-indigo-700 dark:text-indigo-300">One of the fastest ways to do so is by trying to fix bugs.</strong> Debugging forces you to explore different modules in the repository, which helps you build a mental map of how the different parts are connected. </p><p class="mb-3 sm:mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-base lg:text-lg leading-6 sm:leading-7 md:leading-7 tracking-[0.01em] sm:tracking-[0.015em] text-wrap-pretty max-w-full sm:max-w-[95%] md:max-w-[90%]"> Once I became familiar with a large portion of the codebase, I decided to plan a bigger project. Initially, I proposed adding support for solving second-order partial differential equations. To my surprise, the idea was rejected—not because it was a bad idea, but because it lacked sufficient applications and use cases within the library. From that experience, I learned two very important lessons (these are my personal takeaways): </p><ul class="py-1 sm:py-2 px-3 sm:px-4 md:px-6 my-1 sm:my-2 mb-4 sm:mb-6 mx-1 sm:mx-2 md:mx-4 rounded-lg bg-indigo-50/30 dark:bg-indigo-900/5 w-full sm:w-[95%] list-outside"><li class="relative leading-6 sm:leading-6 ml-3 sm:ml-4 pb-1 sm:pb-2 pl-1 list-disc"><p class="mb-1 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-base lg:text-lg leading-6 sm:leading-7 tracking-[0.01em] sm:tracking-[0.015em] inline-block align-top"> You can&#39;t overload a repository with niche features that have little to no user demand.

Rather than focusing on why I chose this project, I want to share how I selected it. As of now, SymPy has a well-developed series module, but one major bottleneck is the speed of series expansion. In GSoC 2015, Shivam Vats improved this by introducing ring_series in the polys module, which is significantly faster compared to the global series implementation in SymPy. However, this came at the cost of user-friendly syntax. Additionally, the master function of ring_series, which is rs_series, uses raw expressions instead of structured data types like Poly. In calculus, we learn series much like polynomials—the operations we apply to polynomials can be applied to series as well. So, my goal was to maintain both speed and improve ease of use for users. </p><p class="mb-3 sm:mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-base lg:text-lg leading-6 sm:leading-7 md:leading-7 tracking-[0.01em] sm:tracking-[0.015em] text-wrap-pretty max-w-full sm:max-w-[95%] md:max-w-[90%]"><strong class="font-bold text-indigo-700 dark:text-indigo-300">Key Takeaway</strong> you can take from this when working on any open-source project, the two main goals should be: </p><ul class="py-1 sm:py-2 px-3 sm:px-4 md:px-6 my-1 sm:my-2 mb-4 sm:mb-6 mx-1 sm:mx-2 md:mx-4 rounded-lg bg-indigo-50/30 dark:bg-indigo-900/5 w-full sm:w-[95%] list-outside"><li class="relative leading-6 sm:leading-6 ml-3 sm:ml-4 pb-1 sm:pb-2 pl-1 list-disc"><p class="mb-1 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-base lg:text-lg leading-6 sm:leading-7 tracking-[0.01em] sm:tracking-[0.015em] inline-block align-top"> Performance (speed) </p></li><li class="relative leading-6 sm:leading-6 ml-3 sm:ml-4 pb-1 sm:pb-2 pl-1 list-disc"><p class="mb-1 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-base lg:text-lg leading-6 sm:leading-7 tracking-[0.01em] sm:tracking-[0.015em] inline-block align-top"> Ease of use (friendly syntax and interface) </p></li></ul><p class="mb-3 sm:mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-base lg:text-lg leading-6 sm:leading-7 md:leading-7 tracking-[0.01em] sm:tracking-[0.015em] text-wrap-pretty max-w-full sm:max-w-[95%] md:max-w-[90%]"> These are <em class="italic bg-indigo-50/50 dark:bg-indigo-900/10 px-2 py-0.5 rounded inline-block">crucial reasons</em> why someone chooses to adopt and continue using your project. </p><p class="font-bold text-xl sm:text-3xl md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl mt-6 mb-2 leading py-2 px-2 rounded-md bg-gray-100/70 dark:bg-gray-900/40 w-full"> Tips on Open Source </p><p class="pt-2 font-bold text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-xl lg:text-2xl leading-snug text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 border-b border-dashed border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 w-full"> 1.
