from sympy import ZZ, QQ

&quot;&quot;&quot;Create the ring R over QQ with default precision, which is 6.&quot;&quot;&quot;
R = power_series_ring(QQ)
RQQ = power_series_ring(QQ, 10)
RZZ = power_series_ring(ZZ, 10)

&quot;&quot;&quot;Let&#39;s create a ring with precision 8 over the integers:&quot;&quot;&quot;
R = power_series_ring(ZZ, prec=8)
f = R([1, 2, 3])
g = R([4, 1])

&quot;&quot;&quot;Arithmetic operations are performed using the ring&#39;s methods. The print
method provides a readable string representation.&quot;&quot;&quot;
R.print(R.add(f, g))
R.print(R.multiply(f, g))

&quot;&quot;&quot;As shown below, when the result of an operation is a polynomial with a
degree less than the ring&#39;s precision, the exact result is returned.&quot;&quot;&quot;
p = R([2, -3])
q = R([0, 7, 6, 1])
R.print(R.multiply(p, q))

&quot;&quot;&quot;However, if an operation produces a result that exceeds the precision
threshold, it is automatically truncated.&quot;&quot;&quot;
r = R([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
s = R([0, 1, 1])
R.print(R.multiply(r, s))

&quot;&quot;&quot;Some series expansions:
Currently, it only allows the Taylor expansion when x=0.
So, almost all the provided functions in the QQ class work when the series
has zero constant term, except log.

Keep in mind the series expansion for this trancendental function contain
the rational coeffs so it need the Ring over QQ.&quot;&quot;&quot;
R = power_series_ring(QQ, 8)
R.print(R.log(R.add(R.one, R.gen)))
R.print(R.tan(R.gen))
