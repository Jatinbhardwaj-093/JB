# GSoC-25: Week 7 Update

This week focused heavily on **code cleanup**, particularly refining **type annotations** and ensuring **method consistency**. While progress was slower than anticipated due to my programming exam, I've made significant strides towards completing my current Pull Request.

A key development this week was the merge of **[gh-28236](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/28236)** by **Oscar**. This PR introduces enhanced type annotation functionality for `dup` elements, providing a **`dup` type alias**. I'm currently evaluating how extensively to integrate this new alias, replacing generic list types for improved clarity and type checker compatibility.

### Series Division Implementation

The major new feature implemented this week is the **division operation for series**. This proved to be a particularly tricky challenge. Typically, series division is performed by inverting the divisor and then multiplying. For example, to find $s_1 / s_2$:

1.  Calculate the inverse of $s_2$: $H = 1/s_2$.
2.  Multiply $s_1$ by $H$: $s_1 \times H$.

The primary hurdle arose when the divisor ($s_2$) lacked an invertible constant term, as is common with series like $x$ or $x + x^2 + x^3 + \dots$. I initially overcomplicated this, focusing on the absence of a constant term and potential series shifts. However, the solution was simpler: the key is to **synchronize the shift of $s_1$ with $s_2$** to ensure mathematical correctness in the operation. This adjustment allows for accurate division even in cases where the constant term is missing.

With a few remaining checks and minor adjustments, I'm optimistic about getting this PR merged today or tomorrow.
