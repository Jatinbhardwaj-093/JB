# GSoC '25: Week 12

A few days ago, my GSoC project was wrapped up and completed. I am very happy that I was able to finish within my original timeline. Now I'm just waiting for the final evaluation - the whole journey has been amazing!

There are many things accomplished in this project, and everything is explained on the SymPy official wiki page, including future progress plans for this module. I'll link the important resources below for anyone interested.

I hope to write a separate blog post explaining how this system works, how it can be used, and the decision tree of what was done and why it was implemented this way.

**Final Report:** [SymPy Wiki](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2025-Report-Jatin-Bhardwaj:-%22A-New-Power-Series-Ring-Module-for-SymPy%22)
